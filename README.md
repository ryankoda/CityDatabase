# CityDatabase
## Developed on iPhone 8 aspect ratio and resolution
### Simple database that handles a list of cities in addition to an image and description.
### Cities are able to be added/deleted.
### When a city is clicked on in the table view cell, it segues to a view controller with the coordinates of the city and a map with a pin indicating where it is.
### The user is able to interact with the search bar and search for local points of interest, such as food, coffee, activities, etc.
### The thumbnail image of the city on the main view controller is able to be changed via the detailed view controller by selecting a picture that is on the iOS device.
